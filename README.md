# Predicting-MPG

This project is about predicting mpg of a car based on different variables using linear regression. This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. <br/>Variables that are available in the data set are 
1. mpg:           continuous
2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete
3. displacement:  continuous
4. horsepower:    continuous
5. weight:        continuous
6. acceleration:  continuous
7. model year:    multi-valued discrete
8. origin:        multi-valued discrete
9. car name:      string (unique for each instance)
    
You can read more about the data set at auto-mpg.names file present in the project

## auto_mpg.R

auto_mpg.R file contains all the R code which is used to predict mpg based on different variables.

## auto_mpg.csv

auto_mpg.csv file contains all the data that is used to predict the mpg values.
  
## Problem Statement

please refer the file "Problem Statement.txt" for the problem statement related to the project

## R Final Document

"R Final Document.PDF" contains the final report and conclusions of the project.

## Running the code

While running the R code make sure that you have included the correct path for the csv to file to be read in the line '119'.
replace the path for the code car_data_copy<-read.csv('C:/Users/prana/Desktop/R Project/auto-mpg.csv') with correct csv path.
