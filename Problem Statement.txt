In this project you will investigate the impact of a number of automobile
engine factors on the vehicle's mpg. The dataset auto-mpg.data contains infor-
mation for 398 dierent automobile models. Information regarding the number
of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin,
and car name as well as mpg are contained in the file.

1. Using the first 300 samples in the auto-mpg.data, run a simple linear regres-
sion to determine the relationship between mpg and a single, appropriate
dependent variable of your choice. Report all appropriate information re-
garding your regression and include explanatory graphs.
In addition, include plots for the following:
(a) residuals vs. the predictor variable
(b) absolute value of the residuals vs. the predictor variable
(c) histogram of the residuals
Examine the above plots and discuss how you might interpret these plots
to determine the appropriateness of your linear model.
For the remaining 98 samples in the dataset, use your linear model to
predict each automobile's mpg and report how your predictions compare
to the car's actual reported mgp.

2. Repeat 1., this time using more than one independent variable. Try to con-
struct a methodology for determining which independent factors should
be included to obtain the \best" linear model for mpg. Note that you will
have to modify your approach to the examination of the residuals as there
should now be more than one independent variable in your model.
